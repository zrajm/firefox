# Firefox Hoops

<toc heading=Contents class=toc>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm no fan of any of the major browsers, but I've settled on Firefox (for
good?), because it's the only one that allows for plugins (addons? extensions?
whatever!) in the Android version, which is the only way of getting decent
adblocking on my phone.


## [#plugins] Anti-Capitalist Plugins

The first two installed plugins on any device where I install a browser is:

* [uBlock Origin] – Removes ads, popups and other annoyances.
* [SponsorBlock] – Skip sponsor bits in Youtube videos.

This setup is pretty neat, since it'll allow you to watch Youtube without ads,
and it also skips most sponsored segments inside videos. Occasionally, when I
get an unfiltered view of the internet on someone else's computer (someone who
isn't running the above plugins) I'm quite *horrified*.


## [#resources] Resource Hog

All browsers eat CPU cycles (and memory) *with a spoon*. Firefox is no
exception. A long running browser can bring a machine to its knees by simply
taking grabbing more and more memory until there's nothing left. And trying to
limit how much memory Firefox is allowed to expend using `ulimit` results in
the browser crashing when it hits the memory limit.

I have also noticed that addons can sorta chew away at the memory over time.
But rather than restarting them or Firefox, they can be made to release some of
their memory using the below `about:memory` trick.

* `Shift-Esc` opens the “Process Manager” – Here you can see which tabs are
  currently eating up your CPU and memory. Tabs can also be unloaded from here.
* `about:memory` – Firefox won't open links to about-pages, so either type it
  into the URL bar yourself, or right-click on the link, select “Open Link in
  New Tab”, and then press `Ctrl-L` (to focus the URL field in the browser) and
  press `Enter` to reload it. – Here the “Minimize memory usage” can be used to
  make Firefox behave for a while.
