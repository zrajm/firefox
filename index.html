# [#why] Why Firefox?

Neither of the major browsers are particularly appealing to me, but there's one
killer feature that is only available in Firefox---*Extensions on Android!*

As this *one thing* allows for adblocking and sponsorblocking *on my phone,*
making Youtube, Google and the rest of the internet kinda bearable even when
I'm without my laptop.

On my computers then?---Well, it's nice that Firefox can share data between
phone and my other instances (tab state, mostly), but mostly I don't like the
default appearance of our browsers nowadays, and Firefox is *way more*
customizable on that front (see above screenshot).


## Search Engine

I use (still) use Google for a search engine, however, adding `&udm=14` at the
end of the search URL greatly improves the search results, by only showing
classic web search result (skipping all AI generated, and 'People also searched
for' etc. irrelevancies).

To add the magical `&udm=14` option to Firefox's default search, you must first
add this as a search engine to Firefox, then set it as the default engine. The
easiest way to add it is to, right now (while visiting this page), right-click
in the address bar, then the context menu that appears, select 'Add "Google +
UDM14"' (or go to [Mycroft Project] page, find "Google + UDM14", and do the
same there).

To set it as the default engine to use, go to 'Settings â€º Search' and under
'Default Search Engine' (at the top of the page) select 'Google + UDM14'.


## [#plugins] Anti-Capitalist Plugins

The first two installed plugins on any device where I install a browser is:

* [uBlock Origin]---Removes ads, popups and other annoyances.
* [SponsorBlock]---Skip sponsor bits in Youtube videos.

This setup is pretty neat, since it'll allow you to watch Youtube without ads,
and it also skips most sponsored segments inside videos. Occasionally, when I
get an unfiltered view of the internet on someone else's computer (someone who
isn't running the above plugins) I'm quite *horrified*.


## [#resources] Resource Hog

All browsers eat CPU cycles (and memory) *with a spoon*. Firefox is no
exception. A long running browser can bring a machine to its knees by simply
taking grabbing more and more memory until there's nothing left. And trying to
limit how much memory Firefox is allowed to expend using `ulimit` results in
the browser crashing when it hits the memory limit.

I have also noticed that addons can sorta chew away at the memory over time.
But rather than restarting them or Firefox, they can be made to release some of
their memory using the below `about:memory` trick.

* Shift+Esc---Pressing this keyboard shortcut opens Firefox's "Process Manager"
  in a new tab. Here you can see which tabs are currently chewing up your CPU
  and memory. Tabs can also be unloaded from here.
* `about:memory`---Type this Firefox-internal address into the address bar to
  reveal some memory-related options. Most useful here is the "Minimize memory
  usage" button (under "Free memory").
